\section{Structured Data Processing}

Structured data processing represents a critical domain where transformer architectures must navigate complex relationships between entities, schemas, and hierarchical data organizations. Unlike unstructured text or visual data, structured data processing requires tokens that understand database schemas, query languages, data relationships, and transformation pipelines while maintaining referential integrity and supporting complex analytical operations.

The integration of specialized tokens in structured data processing enables AI systems to assist with database design, query optimization, data migration, ETL pipeline development, and automated data analysis workflows while ensuring data quality and consistency across diverse data sources and formats.

\subsection{Schema-Aware Tokens}

Structured data processing requires specialized tokens that understand database schemas, relationships, and constraints.

\subsubsection{Database Schema Tokens}

Database operations require tokens that can represent tables, columns, relationships, and constraints.

The complete implementation is provided in the external code file \texttt{../../code/part2/chapter06/schemaaware\_database\_tokenization\_system.py}. Key components include:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, caption=Core structure (see external file for complete implementation)]
# See ../../code/part2/chapter06/schemaaware_database_tokenization_system.py for the complete implementation
# This shows only the main class structure
class DatabaseSchemaTokenizer:
    # ... (complete implementation in external file)
    pass
\end{lstlisting}
\subsubsection{Data Transformation Tokens}

ETL and data transformation pipelines require specialized tokens for operations and data flow.

\subsection{Best Practices for Structured Data Processing}

Implementing effective structured data processing tokens requires several key considerations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Schema Awareness}: Maintain understanding of database structures and relationships
\item \textbf{Query Optimization}: Support efficient query generation and optimization
\item \textbf{Data Quality}: Integrate data validation and quality checking mechanisms
\item \textbf{Referential Integrity}: Ensure consistency across related data elements
\item \textbf{Scalability}: Design for large-scale data processing requirements
\item \textbf{Security}: Implement appropriate access controls and data privacy measures
\item \textbf{Interoperability}: Support multiple data formats and database systems
\item \textbf{Pipeline Management}: Enable complex ETL and data transformation workflows
\end{enumerate}
The complete implementation is provided in the external code file \texttt{../../code/part2/chapter06/data\_transformation\_and\_etl\_tokenization.py}. Key components include:
