\section{Audio Tokens [AUDIO]}

Audio tokens represent a sophisticated extension of multimodal special tokens into the auditory domain, enabling transformer architectures to process and understand acoustic information alongside visual and textual modalities \citep{baevski2020wav2vec, akbari2021vatt}. Unlike text with its clear word boundaries or images with their defined patches, audio is a continuous, high-frequency signal where information is encoded in subtle changes over time. The central task of an audio token is to discretize this fluid stream of information into meaningful chunks that a transformer can reason about.

The \specialtoken{AUDIO} token serves as a bridge between the continuous, temporal nature of audio signals and the discrete, sequence-based processing paradigm of modern AI systems \citep{borsos2023audiolm, huang2023audiogpt}.

Feedback: This is a strong start. To immediately frame the core challenge, you could add: "Unlike text with its clear word boundaries or images with their defined patches, audio is a continuous, high-frequency signal where information is encoded in subtle changes over time.

Unlike visual information that can be naturally segmented into patches, audio data presents unique challenges due to its temporal continuity, variable sampling rates, and diverse acoustic properties ranging from speech and music to environmental sounds and complex audio scenes.

\subsection{Fundamentals of Audio Representation}

Audio tokens must address the fundamental challenge of converting continuous acoustic signals into discrete representations that can be effectively processed by transformer architectures while preserving essential temporal and spectral characteristics.

\begin{definition}[Audio Token]
An Audio token (\specialtoken{AUDIO}) is a learnable special token that represents acoustic content within a multimodal sequence. It encodes temporal audio features that can participate in attention mechanisms alongside tokens from other modalities, enabling cross-modal understanding and audio-aware applications.
\end{definition}

The design of effective audio tokens involves several key considerations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Temporal Resolution}: Balancing temporal detail with computational efficiency
\item \textbf{Spectral Coverage}: Capturing relevant frequency information across different audio types
\item \textbf{Context Length}: Handling variable-length audio sequences efficiently
\item \textbf{Multi-Scale Features}: Representing both local patterns and global structure
\item \textbf{Cross-Modal Alignment}: Synchronizing with visual and textual information
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Audio Preprocessing and Feature Extraction}

Before integration into multimodal transformers, audio signals require sophisticated preprocessing to extract meaningful features that can be encoded as tokens.

Raw audio waveforms are sampled at very high rates (e.g., 16,000+ samples per second), resulting in extremely long sequences that are computationally infeasible for standard transformers \citep{baevski2020wav2vec}. Therefore, the first step is always to convert the raw audio into a more compressed and meaningful feature representation, such as a spectrogram, which captures the frequency content over time \citep{kong2020diffwave, conneau2020unsupervised}.

\begin{comment}
Feedback: It would be helpful to briefly explain *why* raw audio is not used. For example: "Raw audio waveforms are sampled at very high rates (e.g., 16,000+ samples per second), resulting in extremely long sequences that are computationally infeasible for standard transformers. Therefore, the first step is always to convert the raw audio into a more compressed and meaningful feature representation, such as a spectrogram, which captures the frequency content over time."

STATUS: addressed - added explanation of why raw audio cannot be used directly and the need for feature extraction

\subsection{Audio Token Architecture}

Integrating audio tokens into multimodal transformers requires careful architectural design to handle the unique properties of audio data.

\subsubsection{Audio Encoder Design}

The key challenge in designing an audio encoder is converting the continuous, high-frequency audio signals into discrete token representations that can participate in transformer attention mechanisms. The encoder must handle temporal sequences of audio features while maintaining the ability to interact with tokens from other modalities.

The audio encoder follows a three-stage process:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Feature Projection}: Convert raw audio features (like mel-spectrograms) to the transformer's embedding dimension
\item \textbf{Temporal Encoding}: Add positional information to capture the sequential nature of audio
\item \textbf{Context Building}: Use transformer layers to build contextual representations that can serve as audio tokens
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Best Practices and Guidelines}

Implementing effective audio tokens requires adherence to several key principles:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Feature Diversity}: Start with log-Mel spectrograms as a strong, general-purpose feature. If your task involves music, consider adding features like chroma or pitch to provide more relevant information to the model
\item \textbf{Temporal Alignment}: When working with video, be aware of potential audio-visual desynchronization in your dataset. A common preprocessing step is to use a tool like FFmpeg to verify and correct the alignment between audio and video streams
\item \textbf{Noise Robustness}: Incorporate audio-specific data augmentation during training. Libraries like \texttt{audiomentations} can add background noise, reverberation, and pitch shifts, which can significantly improve the model's real-world performance
\item \textbf{Scale Invariance}: Handle audio of different durations and sampling rates
\item \textbf{Domain Adaptation}: Fine-tune for specific audio domains (speech, music, environmental)
\item \textbf{Efficient Processing}: Optimize for real-time applications when required
\item \textbf{Cross-Modal Validation}: Evaluate performance on multimodal tasks
\item \textbf{Interpretability}: Monitor attention patterns between audio and other modalities
\end{enumerate}
\begin{comment}
Feedback: This is a great list. To make it more actionable:
1.  **Feature Diversity**: "Start with log-Mel spectrograms as a strong, general-purpose feature. If your task involves music, consider adding features like chroma or pitch to provide more relevant information to the model."
