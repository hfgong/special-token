% Computational Efficiency Optimization for Special Tokens

\section{Computational Efficiency}

The computational efficiency of special tokens directly impacts the practical deployment and scalability of transformer models. While special tokens provide significant functional benefits, they also introduce computational overhead through increased vocabulary sizes, additional attention computations, and more complex processing pathways. This section presents comprehensive strategies for optimizing the computational efficiency of special tokens while maintaining or enhancing their functional effectiveness.

\subsection{Computational Overhead Analysis}

Understanding the computational costs associated with special tokens is essential for effective optimization. These costs manifest across multiple dimensions of the computational pipeline.

\subsubsection{Attention Computation Overhead}

Special tokens participate in attention computations as both sources and targets, contributing to the quadratic scaling of attention complexity.
