% Computational Efficiency Optimization for Special Tokens

\section{Computational Efficiency}

The computational efficiency of special tokens directly impacts the practical deployment and scalability of transformer models. While special tokens provide significant functional benefits, they also introduce computational overhead through increased vocabulary sizes, additional attention computations, and more complex processing pathways. This section presents targeted strategies for optimizing special token computational efficiency while maintaining their functional effectiveness.

\subsection{Special Token-Specific Overhead Analysis}

Special tokens introduce unique computational costs that differ from regular content tokens. Understanding these costs is essential for targeted optimization.

\subsubsection{Vocabulary Size Impact}

Each additional special token increases the embedding table size and output projection computations. For models with large vocabularies, even a small number of special tokens can have measurable impact on memory usage and inference speed.

\subsubsection{Attention Pattern Complexity}

Special tokens often require different attention patterns than content tokens. For example, a \cls{} token may need to attend to all positions in the sequence, while a \sep{} token may only need local attention. These specialized patterns can be optimized for efficiency.

\subsection{Efficiency Optimization Strategies}

Optimizing special token efficiency requires targeted approaches that consider their unique roles and interaction patterns.

\subsubsection{Selective Attention Computation}

Rather than computing full attention for all special tokens, selective computation can focus resources where they have the greatest functional impact.

\subsubsection{Special Token Pooling}

Multiple special tokens with similar functions can be pooled or merged to reduce computational overhead while maintaining representational capacity.
