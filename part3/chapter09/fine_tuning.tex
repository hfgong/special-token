% Fine-tuning Strategies for Special Tokens

\section{Fine-tuning}

Fine-tuning transformer models with special tokens for downstream tasks requires specialized strategies that preserve the functional capabilities developed during pretraining while adapting to new domains and task requirements. Unlike standard fine-tuning that primarily focuses on adapting content representations, fine-tuning with special tokens must carefully balance the preservation of specialized functions with the need for task-specific adaptation. This section presents comprehensive approaches for fine-tuning models with special tokens.

\subsection{Function-Preserving Fine-tuning}

The primary challenge in fine-tuning models with special tokens is maintaining the specialized functions developed during pretraining while enabling adaptation to downstream tasks.

\subsubsection{Selective Parameter Fine-tuning}

Not all model parameters should be fine-tuned equally when special tokens are involved. Selective fine-tuning strategies can preserve critical special token functions while enabling task adaptation.

\subsection{Domain Adaptation Strategies}

When fine-tuning models with special tokens for new domains, additional considerations arise regarding how special token functions should adapt to domain-specific requirements.

\subsubsection{Progressive Domain Adaptation}

Gradual adaptation to new domains can help preserve general special token functions while developing domain-specific capabilities.

\subsubsection{Multi-Domain Fine-tuning}

Training on multiple domains simultaneously can help maintain general functionality while developing specialized capabilities.

\subsection{Task-Specific Adaptation}

Different downstream tasks may require different adaptations of special token functionality, necessitating task-specific fine-tuning strategies.

\subsubsection{Function Augmentation}

Some tasks may benefit from augmenting existing special token functions with additional capabilities rather than modifying core functions.

\subsubsection{Selective Function Modification}

Careful analysis can identify which special token functions should be modified for specific tasks and which should be preserved.
