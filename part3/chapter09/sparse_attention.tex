\section{Sparse Attention for Special Tokens}

Sparse attention mechanisms can significantly improve the efficiency of special token processing by reducing the quadratic complexity of standard attention while maintaining the functional effectiveness of special tokens \citep{child2019generating, beltagy2020longformer}.

\subsection{Special Token-Aware Sparse Patterns}

Rather than applying generic sparse attention patterns, special token-aware patterns can optimize both efficiency and functionality. For example, a \cls{} token might use a global attention pattern while other tokens use local patterns.

\subsection{Dynamic Sparsity Based on Token Type}

Different special tokens can use different levels of sparsity based on their functional requirements. Tokens that require global information aggregation may use denser attention patterns, while structural tokens like \sep{} may use very sparse patterns.

\subsection{Implementation Considerations}

Implementing sparse attention for special tokens requires careful consideration of the interaction between sparsity patterns and token functionality to ensure that efficiency gains don't compromise model performance.
