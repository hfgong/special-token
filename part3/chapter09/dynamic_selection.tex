\section{Dynamic Special Token Management}

Dynamic management of special tokens allows models to adapt their token usage in real-time based on input characteristics, task requirements, and computational constraints. This represents an advanced form of conditional computation specifically tailored for special tokens.

\subsection{Context-Aware Token Activation}

Rather than using a fixed set of special tokens for all inputs, context-aware activation selects which special tokens to use based on the content and structure of the input sequence. This optimizes both performance and efficiency.

\subsection{Adaptive Token Routing}

Advanced models can learn to route information through different special tokens based on the specific requirements of each processing step, creating dynamic pathways that optimize information flow.

\subsection{Computational Budget Management}

Dynamic selection can operate under computational budget constraints, choosing the most effective combination of special tokens within available computational resources.
