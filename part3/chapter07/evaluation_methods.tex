% Evaluation Methods for Custom Special Tokens

\section{Evaluation Methods}

The evaluation of custom special tokens requires comprehensive methodologies that assess both their functional effectiveness and their integration quality within transformer architectures. Unlike standard model evaluation that focuses primarily on task performance, custom token evaluation must consider architectural impact, training dynamics, computational efficiency, and interpretability. This section presents systematic approaches for evaluating custom special tokens across multiple dimensions.

\subsection{Functional Effectiveness Evaluation}

Functional effectiveness measures how well custom tokens achieve their intended purpose and contribute to overall model performance.

\subsubsection{Task-Specific Performance Metrics}

Custom tokens should demonstrably improve performance on their target tasks compared to baseline models without the custom tokens.
